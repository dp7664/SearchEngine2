# SearchEngine2
For this project, I developed a comprehensive search engine using Java Servlet, SQL, HTML, Jsoup, and JConnector technologies. The search engine provides users with the ability to perform searches and view the results in a well-organized tabular form, complete with associated links to the respective web pages.

The core functionalities of the search engine include web scraping using Jsoup to gather relevant data from various sources. By integrating JConnector, the application effectively communicates with the SQL database to store and retrieve search results and user search history.

Additionally, I implemented a user-friendly feature that displays the search history, allowing users to review their past searches and easily revisit previously explored content.

Throughout the development process, I prioritized scalability, efficiency, and user experience to create a reliable and feature-rich search engine. The project showcases my skills in Java development, database management, web scraping, and front-end design. I am proud to have delivered a valuable tool that simplifies information retrieval and enhances the user's browsing experience.
